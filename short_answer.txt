1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?
    In the HTTP protocol:

Client Sends Requests: The client sends requests to servers. It might request a web page, a file, or some other resource.

Server Sends Responses: The server receives these requests and then sends back responses to the client. 
These responses usually contain the requested information, like a web page, a file, or data from a database.

So, to simplify, in HTTP, the main difference between client vs server is:

The client asks (sends requests).
The server answers (sends responses).

2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

In the context of web development and APIs, a "route" refers to a specific URL endpoint that a server can respond to. A route is a mapping between 
a URL endpoint and a specific function or handler in a web application or API. When a client makes 
a request to a particular URL endpoint, the web server uses the corresponding route to determine 
which code should handle the request and generate a response.

3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter

Answer:
The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter.
The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home.
The server runs a function associated with the route /home, which produces some HTML.
The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response.
The user's browser displays the HTML it received.
